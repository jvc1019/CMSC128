# CMSC128

This will be the repository for CMSC 128 - Section 3.
Files included would be for the prototype system we will
create in the scrum process through series of sprints.

FIRST PROTOTYPE CONSULTATION SHOULD BE DONE BEFORE NOVEMBER 10, 2020.

Next sprint deadline is November 10, 2020.

First sprint has passed on October 22, 2020.
The first sprint included the mockup designs for our project.
It also included the relational model of the database.

# Quick Start Guide

1. All major components should be wrapped in a div with a class "container". That way, it will be easier to apply color schemes and other customization.

```html
<div class="container">
  <!-- stuff goes here -->
</div>
```

2. All major components should include the header.php file at the top. The header.php file contains the head, with the necessary CSS and JS files for cleaner and consistent code.

```php
<?php include('header.php'); ?>
```

After including header.php, only the body needs to be defined. See tasks.php to see how it works.

```html
<body>
  <!-- stuff goes here -->
</body>
```

3. For subcomponents that need database access, you can include conn.php. See tasks_add.php to see how it works.

```php
include('conn.php');
```
